            Biodiversity, as the name suggests, is the variety of species here on Earth. It is extremely important for many reasons.

  `Bacteria and Viruses:
Many viruses and pandemics had an outbreak after the biodiversity of the place reduced.
Imagine if you are a virus, and you need a host to multiply. 
You normally would use the variety of species you had, but now the biodiversity has gone down in your area, so you have fewer options. 
Over time, your only choice becomes humans... and then something like Covid-19 happens, and we humans all get sick. 
We need biodiversity to protect us from pathogens and other diseases.`,
  
  `Economy:
Our economy depends on forests. From lumber to paper, we need trees! 
A forest is the best example of biodiversity. All the varieties of plants, animals, and decomposers help the ecosystem thrive. 
With a sudden decrease in biodiversity, the balance in the ecosystem would be disrupted, and plants and animals will die off, including trees. 
Then the economy will tumble down because lumber and paper products will all be gone.`,

  `Culture:
Over centuries, people have adapted to the place where they lived, through culture. 
Their culture doesn't just represent their beliefs, but also the place around them. 
The species there, the types of trees and plants, and the food that they eat.
They use their surroundings to their benefit, but without biodiversity, they won't even have plants or animals they can use. 
The different plants and animals sustain themselves and keep populations in check, but if biodiversity goes down, one dominant apex predator could make all other species extinct. 
Eventually, it will starve to extinction, and the culture that depended on those animals and plants might be wiped out.`

<h2>How to Help</h2>
<p>
If you think that just you yourself cannot make a change in biodiversity, then you're wrong.
You can help in so many ways. 
First, stop using pesticides. They kill good organisms that PROTECT your plants, and it disrupts the food chain, reducing biodiversity.
Then, talk with your neighbor and ask them to stop using pesticides. Eventually, talk with your community, and lead them into the bright, leafy, green world.

    These are some places near Plano, TX. You can help the environment by going there and learning about the environment in Texas. 
    You can implement those ideas you found thereâ€”maybe go pick up trash in a park or buy native pollinators and put them in your backyard.
